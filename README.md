# 🚀 Nikco Hub // Interactive Link Page

## About The Project
A minimalist yet visually engaging "Link-in-Bio" page created to centralize all my social media links, GitHub projects, and contact information in one place.

The page features modern effects enabled by CSS and JavaScript:
* **3D Interactivity:** The link cards dynamically tilt when hovered over (using CSS `transform-style: preserve-3d`).
* **Parallax Effect:** The entire scene slightly shifts and tilts based on the cursor position (controlled by JavaScript).
* **Dynamic Background:** An animated background (GIF/Video) is used, with a blur overlay for improved text contrast.

## 🔗 Live Demo
* **Visit the live page here:** [https://codingwnikco.github.io/Nikco-Hub/](https://codingwnikco.github.io/Nikco-Hub/)

## 🛠️ Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS Grids, 3D Transforms)
* Vanilla JavaScript (for the Parallax effect)
